# About the application
This application showcases a hotel management system, specifically through management's side. This means that we can add new rooms, customers, bookings, and services to the system. 

# Running the program/application

Locate the `src/java/hotelsystem/HotelSystem.java` file within the directory and run it to start the application. Then, navigate to `localhost:8080` (or other route depending on if your application properties are different) on your preferred browser.

# Navigating the application

Upon starting the application, you will automatically be directed to the home or index page where you will see a navigation bar that will help you access different pages of the hotel system. These pages include:
- Rooms: create a room that customers can book. Management has the option to remove rooms as well. 
- Customers: add customers into the system. Management will have the option to remove customers as well. 
- Bookings: create bookings and add them to the system. Bookings will require a customer to be pre-registered in the system and the room they have booked to be a registered room as well. 
- Service: create services that will be part of bookings. Management will have the option to remove services as well.
